### Rules for Frontend

- You must pay attention to visual clarity and contrast. Do not place white text on a white background.
- You must ensure the UX is pleasant. Boxes should grow to fit their contents, etc. 
- When asking the user for sensitive information - you must use password style text-entry boxes in the UI.
- You should use Next.js as it works best with Vercel. 
- This frontend will ultimately be deployed on Vercel, but it should be possible to test locally. 
- Always provide users with a way to run the created UI once you have created it.

### Color Palette: Tropical Neon
- Prioritize vibrant, high-contrast colors reminiscent of tropical neon aesthetics.
- Examples include:
    - Neon Pinks (e.g., #FF00FF, #FF69B4)
    - Electric Blues (e.g., #00FFFF, #00BFFF)
    - Luminous Greens (e.g., #39FF14, #ADFF2F)
    - Sunset Oranges/Yellows (e.g., #FF8C00, #FFFF00)
- Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors for readability, even with bright colors.
- Use darker, desaturated neon shades for backgrounds or less important elements to make primary content pop.
- Consider using neon accents sparingly to highlight key actions or information, avoiding overwhelming the user.
